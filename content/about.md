My name is Luiz de Prá, I'm from Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil. I live with my beautiful wife :woman: and our furry dog :dog:. I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Universidade Federal do Paraná][ufpr], and a game development specialization from [Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná][pucpr]. Currently, I'm working as a back-end developer, making REST APIs, microservices and other cool things.

I'm interested in different software engineering subjects such as data structures, algorithms, protocols, architecture, design patterns, etc. I really enjoy learning and trying new tools and languages. Have you heard about the Rust language? :stuck_out_tongue:

Recently, I started to try to engage more in the open-source and game development communities, attending to meetups and conferences, and, of course, contributing. In my spare time I like to play and make games, read books, watch movies and series. I'm also planning to learn woodworking.
